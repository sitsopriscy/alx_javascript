// Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

// You must use the class notation for defining your class
// The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
// Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
// Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
// If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
// Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
// Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
// Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2
